            "<p>Now, confession time: I’m not really a programmer. I’ve dabbled here and there, but mostly I’m just someone who gets frustrated when tools don’t work the way I want them to. Every time I tried using online calculators, they were always missing something important. EMI calculators without prepayment options, no way to adjust interest rates, no top-ups. BMI tools that wouldn’t even let me pick the right units. It drove me nuts.</p>",
            "<p>So I thought, *“Fine, I’ll build it myself.”* 💪 But here’s the twist—I didn’t do it alone. I teamed up with AI, describing the features I wanted, and together we turned ideas into reality. It’s like having a coding buddy who never gets tired of hearing me say, *“What if we add this?”* 🤖</p>",
            "<p>And that’s how this site was born. Not to make money (though hey, I wouldn’t complain), but because I believe everyone deserves simple, powerful, and user-friendly tools. It’s also my way of giving back to the internet that’s given me so much over the years.</p>",
            "<p>Now we’ve got BMI calculators that actually consider age and gender, EMI calculators with charts and smart prepayment options, investment projections that make sense, unit converters that don’t make you pull your hair out, and more. Basically, everything I wished existed when I was stuck with frustrating tools.</p>",
            "<p>By finding this little Easter egg, you’ve shown the same curiosity this project was built with. So go ahead, share it with friends—let them know there’s a hidden story waiting for them too. 🥚✨</p>",
            "<p>And hey… surprise! You actually read the whole story! 🎊 Since you were curious enough to find this Easter egg and stick around through my rambling, here’s a little <strong>reward</strong> just for you:</p>",
