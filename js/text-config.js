            "<p>Now, confession time: I‚Äôm not really a programmer. I‚Äôve dabbled here and there, but mostly I‚Äôm just someone who gets frustrated when tools don‚Äôt work the way I want them to. Every time I tried using online calculators, they were always missing something important. EMI calculators without prepayment options, no way to adjust interest rates, no top-ups. BMI tools that wouldn‚Äôt even let me pick the right units. It drove me nuts.</p>",
            "<p>So I thought, *‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll build it myself.‚Äù* üí™ But here‚Äôs the twist‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt do it alone. I teamed up with AI, describing the features I wanted, and together we turned ideas into reality. It‚Äôs like having a coding buddy who never gets tired of hearing me say, *‚ÄúWhat if we add this?‚Äù* ü§ñ</p>",
            "<p>And that‚Äôs how this site was born. Not to make money (though hey, I wouldn‚Äôt complain), but because I believe everyone deserves simple, powerful, and user-friendly tools. It‚Äôs also my way of giving back to the internet that‚Äôs given me so much over the years.</p>",
            "<p>Now we‚Äôve got BMI calculators that actually consider age and gender, EMI calculators with charts and smart prepayment options, investment projections that make sense, unit converters that don‚Äôt make you pull your hair out, and more. Basically, everything I wished existed when I was stuck with frustrating tools.</p>",
            "<p>By finding this little Easter egg, you‚Äôve shown the same curiosity this project was built with. So go ahead, share it with friends‚Äîlet them know there‚Äôs a hidden story waiting for them too. ü•ö‚ú®</p>",
            "<p>And hey‚Ä¶ surprise! You actually read the whole story! üéä Since you were curious enough to find this Easter egg and stick around through my rambling, here‚Äôs a little <strong>reward</strong> just for you:</p>",
